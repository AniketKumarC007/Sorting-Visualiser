# Sorting Visualizer
This Web application visualises various sorting algorithms namely :

1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort
5. Selection sort

We can visualize the time taken by each algorithm for randomly generated block array number represented by height and analyze its efficiency.

Project used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and knowledge about different sorting algoritms.
